Analysis of data for the *Authentication of primary murine normal and pre-cancer hematopoietic progenitor cell lines by a 
microfluidics-based system* paper submitted in the [International Journal of Cancer](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10970215).

Codes are written in R (stored as a notebook in the *.Rmd* file) from which results and progress of the analysis together with plots are
shown in the *pdf* and *html* preview files. 

The data for the analysis is stored in **src/**.
The separate pca and heatmap plots of the correlation analysis are stored in the **output_plots** directory.
